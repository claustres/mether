# Mether

Mether is a resilient secure distributed application platform using analogies from physics, hence the name created from :
* Matter, any substance made up of elementary building blocks such as quarks.
* Ether, a postulated medium for the propagation of non-mechanical interactions.

A Mether is also a communal or 'Friendship' drinking vessel from the Celtic tradition, visitors were formally welcomed in 'peace and friendship' with a mether, just like we want to welcome you to this community.

While the original utility of analogies was generative â€“ producing a model that explained how it works - the analogy is also useful to communicate to new comers or non-developers about the project. 

Usually, applications are designed to be deployed knowing the state of the underlying infrastructure. Mether provides a new paradigm where the application "shapes" the infrastructure as required just like a man shapes the physical world to create his tools. It means that Mether is a stateless infrastructure. 

## Basic concepts

In Physics, a quark is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. In Mether, a quark is an elementary chunk of data and a fundamental constituent of information. Like in Physics, there are different types of quarks known as flavors. Flavors are non-hierarchical metadata assigned to a piece of information, like tags or labels, and allows a quark to be described and found again by searching. Quark content addressing is based on cryptographic-hashes allowing integrity checking and providing wide, secure, trustless exchanges of data. 

In Mether, atoms are the smallest constituent unit of application that can reliably be moved from one computing environment to another, a.k.a. containers. 

In Physics, a molecule consists of a stable system composed of two or more atoms exhibing specific properties. In Mether, molecules adds a higher level of abstraction to atoms, which are containerized components. A molecule consists of one or more co-located atoms and can be typically seen as a microservice.

In Physics, atoms interact, form molecules, and manifest further properties through interactions and force carriers or messenger particles of underlying fields. In Mether, application components interact through a serverless messaging system supported by a field of computers.
