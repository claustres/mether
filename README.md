# Mether

Mether is a resilient secure distributed application platform using analogies from physics, hence the name created from :
* Matter, any substance made up of elementary building blocks such as quarks.
* Ether, a postulated medium for the propagation of non-mechanical interactions.

While the original utility of analogies was generative â€“ producing a model that explained how it works - the analogy is also useful to communicate to new comers or non-developers about the project. 

In Physics, a quark is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. In Mether, a quark is an elementary chunk of data and a fundamental constituent of information. Like in Physics, there are different types of quarks known as flavors. Flavors are non-hierarchical metadata assigned to a piece of information, like tags, and allows a quark to be described and found again by searching. Quark content addressing is based on cryptographic-hashes allowing integrity checking and providing wide, secure, trustless exchanges of data.
